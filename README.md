# Bunny-s-And-Badgers-Game-Python-Project
A simple game in Python where the hero, the bunny has to defend a castle against an attacking horde of badgers. 
 
Objective: Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language. Pygame is a python library that makes writing games a lot easier! It provides functionality such as image handling and sound playback that we can easily incorporate into our game.  
 
• The main goal is to protect something from the opponent that belongs to the player and at the same time also avoid being killed. 

• Destroy/Kill the opponents from the game. Chess is a well-known example where you must eliminate the opposing forces to win. Here the bunny needs to destroy the enemies/badgers in order to protect the castle. 

• The focus is not necessarily on destroying the opponent, but also to protect it’s own territory. Here the bunny needs to save the castle from the enemies. 

• All the above objectives should be achieved within the specified time limit as well as the resources allocated to the player.
